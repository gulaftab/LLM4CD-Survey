## Code Representations
Papers that focus on token-level, AST-based, graph-based, and embedding-based representations of source code for clone detection.

## Deep Learning Approaches
Includes work based on CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Siamese networks, transformers, and hybrid architectures.

##  LLM-Based Techniques
Research exploring the use of large language models:
- Prompting (zero-shot, few-shot)
- Fine-tuning
- Synthetic data generation and augmentation

##  Datasets and Benchmarks
Surveys major datasets including BigCloneBench, POJ-104, CodeNet, and others.


##  Interpretability and Analysis
Work focused on understanding and explaining deep and LLM-based models for code similarity.

## Research Frontiers
Highlights open problems and emerging trends:
- Semantic clone detection
- Cross-language clone detection
- Generalization to unseen codebases

## Resources and Toolkits
Links to datasets, pretrained models, benchmarks, and open-source toolkits supporting clone detection research.
